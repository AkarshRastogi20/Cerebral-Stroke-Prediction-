# Cerebral-Stroke-Prediction-

# About data

The "Cerebral Stroke Prediction" dataset is a real-world dataset used for the task of predicting the occurrence of cerebral strokes in individuals.
The primary goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals who are at a higher risk of suffering a cerebral stroke. Early detection and intervention can be critical in reducing the severity and consequences of strokes.

# Objective: 

In this assignment, you will work with the "Cerebral Stroke Prediction" dataset, which is characterized by class imbalance. Your goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of cerebral strokes and evaluate its performance while addressing the class imbalance challenge.

# Problem statement:

What are the main factors that contribute to stroke occurrence in the dataset?
Can we effectively identify individuals at risk of experiencing cerebral strokes based on their attributes?
How well does the model perform in detecting stroke occurrence while considering the class imbalance?
How can healthcare providers use the model's predictions to improve patient care and reduce the risk of strokes?

# Outcome Variable: 

The target variable is binary and indicates whether a patient had a stroke (positive class) which is denoted with 1 or did not have a stroke (negative class) is denoted with 0. 


# Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of each model using the testing dataset. Calculate the following metrics:

Accuracy
Sensitivity 
Specificity
